# DevOps Tricks

This is a repo of tricks I found and discovered while working on different DevOps projects. I will share them thought some will not be clear outside my own usage.

## Create a virtual box image and install Jenkins inside it
*Folder : jenkins_by_vagrant*
> Will install an ubuntu machine inside virtual box and give you the password and the url for finishing the installation of Jenkins.  
Look at the corresponding readme for more information

## Provision an EC2 server with a webserver (+index.html), ssh access using Terrafom
*Folder : ec2_provisioning_with_terraform*
> You can provision/destroy an EC2 easily  
Look at the corresponding readme for more information


## Setup SonarQube to analyse a unity project
*Folder : sonarqube_with_unity*
> I will install and configure SonarQube on a MacOs then run an analysis on a project from start to end.
> 
## Scenarize with python and yaml
*Folder : scenarize*
> This project, built from a few of my other projects, is a base to scenarize different action. It can for example be used to automate a few steps or do some testing. Each steps can gather datas from others.
